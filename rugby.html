				<h2>Purdue University Men's Rugby Social Media Director</h2>
				
				<p>In February of 2015 I was named as the Social Media Director for Purdue University's rugby team.  It was my responsibility to handle the development and update of the teams website, as well as the managing of the team's Facebook and Twitter accounts.  Part of my responsibilities also included interacting with D1A Rugby administration and BTU Rugby in reporting game statistics after matches.</p><br>
				<p>During my tenure as Social Media Director, I focused on increasing the teams exposure and having a strong online presence with a professional looking website.  Website traffic saw a considerable spike, and the team's Facebook page cracked over 1000 likes (over 10% increase overall) as well as a jump of over 100 new Twitter followers (~20% increase) with over 50k in impressions on Twitter over a year.  I also implemented a recruiting form for prospective players, and Purdue rugby had one of its more successful recruiting seasons and freshman retention compared to years past.</p><br>
				<p>Original source code to my website design can be found on my Github.  The current site is currently undergoing a second makeover being developed my myself.</p>
