So I'm cutting most of them.  It's a waste anyway.  I'm not really interested in making content for this website, I'm interested in making real stuff.  Plus when I upgraded to Gastby 3 it really borked all the site images and if I have to type out one more GraphQL query for childSharpImage I might lose my shit.</p>\n<p>Ran across a really interesting website called the <a href=\"https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/\">Solar Low Tech Magazine</a>, which is essentially an entire website hosted on a solar-powered node.  Uptime depends upon the sun.  Stuff like this is my jam.  So while I'm simply using Github Pages for now, I'm going to try and do something similar later this year (don't hold your breath I have no clue when I will actually get to it).  But this concept of blending the physical and digital world is exactly what I want to do more of.</p>\n<p>I threw my experimental Xbox Menu UI/UX on the sidebar.  It's still a WIP, but that's what this site is -> WIP's.</p>\n<p>Been busy outdoors so I definitely did not get user stat submission done for the start of the MLR season.  So this year definitely won't happen as I wanted, but that's okay.  I'll piece something together for the end of the season for users and work through the next year to get it going.  The aquatic library has a lot of my focus right now anyway.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rethinking this website","summary":"I was trying to make this site too much like a real publication and not enough for what it is: a public sandbox for my ideas.
