My day job has a knack for wiping me out of energy so I can go a few days without doing anything.  This past weekend I unplugged as well.</p>\n<h3>The Rugby App</h3>\n<p>I updated all the ancient packages and did my best to wipe out all my newbie-quality code from years ago (public states?!  Just fade me fam).  So all components are passable now.  Login page looks a lot cleaner.  For the next two weeks, every day I need to update a front-end component while I go back and clean up the back-end code. User registration, stat submissions, and image uploads are the priority.  Everything else <em>mostly</em> works from 2019.  One month until the season starts, so I have a limited window to polish the app.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Aquatic Library</h3>\n<p>Got a general UI/UX demo working of the public client.  Going to reuse a lot of code from the rugby app for managing users.  Probably won't have a demo out until April.  In the mean time, I have been adding species via my concept-testing API I run on my local machine.</p>\n<h3>Fish Updates</h3>\n<p>Speaking of species, I have acquired or in the process of acquiring a few new ones.  First and foremost is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbled_swordtail\">Xiphophorus meyeri</a>, or the Marbled Swordtail.  This species is extinct in the wild, and the only surviving specimens exist in the hands of researchers and hobbyists.  Very uncommon.  They should be arriving next week once the country thaws out and it's safe to ship them.  The second species was pure dumb luck and I haven't found in a store since 2010 - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_cichlid\">Cleithracara maronii</a>, or the Keyhole Cichlid.  After a decade I managed to find a trio on my way home from work and waiting for my takeout order.  Couldn't believe it when I laid eyes on them.  They have settled into quarantine.  The third species I will hold off discussing until it arrives safely.</p>\n<h3>Idea for Component Sandbox</h3>\n<p>Most of Texas and the Midwest are frozen right now from a winter storm and subzero temperatures.  This is playing havoc on the power grids and a lot of people are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/why-texas-energy-grid-unable-handle-winter-storms-n1258049\">sitting in the dark.</a> I've been reading a lot of forums of people desperately trying to keep their aquariums warm but ending up with a bunch of frozen fish.  In this scenario the goal is to eliminate the rate of heat transfer out of the aquarium and into the atmosphere.  While water is a great thermal reservoir, glass is not.  Some <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Owens-Corning-FOAMULAR-150-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-5-Scored-Square-Edge-Rigid-Foam-Board-Insulation-Sheathing-20WE/207179253\">1 in. R-5 Foam Board Insulation</a> pieces could probably help extend the lifespan of a tank for a few days, which might make the difference for these people and more importantly, the fish.  Next addition to the component sandbox will be analyzing the thermal properties of a body of water in a tank.</p>\n<h3>Cool Places I Went</h3>\n<p>Unplugging allowed me to checkout <a href=\"https://www.phoenix.gov/waterservices/tresrios\">Tres Rios Wetlands</a> and <a href=\"https://butterflywonderland.com/\">Butterfly Wonderland</a>, so a double dose of nature.  A lot of great inspiration from these places I'll use for future ideas.</p>\n<h3>Stocks</h3>\n<p>Speculative buys on BMBL, TLRY, VXX, and UVXY.  Probably sling some options on those first two, buy shares on the second.  Buffett Indicator <a href=\"http://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php\">off the charts</a>, these valuations will not hold for long.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming</h3>\n<p>Updates to my custom lighting rig, more rugby app updates, and hopefully a new resident in the fish room...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2/16/2021 Updates","summary":"A few updates from the last week or so with projects, fish, and new ideas.
