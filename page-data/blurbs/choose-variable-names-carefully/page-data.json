It was shorthand for clientConsultantId, which is the ID in another data mining application that has to be cross-referenced with this application.  I named the variable ccId because instead of typing 18 letters, I could type 4.  Well now I hear and read ccId everywhere and it makes me want to jump off a cliff.</p>\n<p>Another great one was duplicateId.  In this instance it the id of another object with similar query parameters.  This ID was captured when an incoming lead would match up on a certain number of criteria (phone number, email, first and last name, etc).  Well in due time the word duplicate was being uttered repeatedly, and the slang \"dupes\" emerged for them.  Getting user feedback on the application and constantly hearing the word \"dupes\" became common practice, and I would have preferred someone grating a fork across a plate while I bit my teeth into freezing cold ice cream than having to listen to that work repeated over and over.</p>\n<p>If you have a variable you know a lot of people will be interacting with, repeat that work about 100 times in your head before you push that code to Git.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Choose your variable names carefully","summary":"You have no idea how an innocuous variable name will begin to grate on your when you have to read it in 100+ emails and over 20 phone calls and meetings.
