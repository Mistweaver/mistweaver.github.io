Definitely a bit outside of my experience range too.  But valuable lessons none the less.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I am not ESPN or Google</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ideas are great on paper, and I had a lot of them.  But implementation and maintenace for a single person was not a sustainable goal.  Before I knew it my entire week was spent watching film, updating states, writing code, answering help requests, and before I knew it the app had rather fallen apart.  I tried to do too much rather than refine scope.  Keep the variables small.  Track fewer stats that don't require my entire weeks dedication.  Moving forward, I am reducing the number of stats I will be tracking.  I can't be ESPN, so I shouldn't try.  Aspirations and goals aren't bad.  But a working app alone and a solid user-base will is priority.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Don't track your own stats</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I love the sport, but I spent enough of my life watching game film.  So for 2021 my plan is to allow users to track and submit their own stats.  If you are watching your favorite team, go ahead and log what you want and submit it.  I can let the computer do resolution between stat discrepancies.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Make everything user-proof</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anytime you add users to an application, you've added a variable of user-error that you will never be able to correct.  Users will get confused, make mistakes, etc.  Within one hour of launching my app, I already had 3 password reset requests and a user that didn't realize passwords were case-sensitive.  Oops.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Simplify the UI</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This iteration is going to be Material UI all the way.  Less custom components.  More modern design that looks professional.  My design skills are lacking and too often seem like they come right out of the 90's/2000's.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Possibly drop the email relay</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This was such a pain in my ass getting it working and working consistently, and I'm not so sure I want to use it going forward.  No clue how I'll handle password resets and notifications, but we will see.  Might be a last minute addition.  I really don't like devops work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rugby App v1 Autopsy","summary":"A quick analysis of the flaws of the first iteration of the app, and improving it moving forward.","date":"03 February, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blurbs/first-rugby-app-autopsy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
