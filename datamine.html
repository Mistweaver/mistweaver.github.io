				<h2>Data mining script</h2><br>
				
				<p>During the summer of 2012 the video game Mechwarrior Online was undergoing its closed beta test that I was lucky enough to participate in.  On my own accord I began crawling user pages of players, gathering their data, and presenting it on the forums.  </p><br>
				<p>The process was rather straightforward - establish a connection with the URL, begin parsing the source code for the member data on each page, store that data, then advance to the next webpage.  The first iteration of the program was written in MATLAB, with a second version developed in Java.  These programs allowed me to assess the approximate size of each faction in the game, who were the top forum posters, who achieved the most liked posts, the overall like/post average, locale, and other metrics of merit. </p><br>
				<p>This program would prove it value several years later, where I was able to utilize the program in my time with Purdue University Libraries IT department.  With this program I was able to parse several thousand web pages that were written in Adobe ColdFusion, pull the necessary data, and rewrite the pages as PHP files, saving several days worth of work to write the pages manually.</p><br>
